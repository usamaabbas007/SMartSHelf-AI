SmartShelf AI
Author: Raja Usama Abbas
Project Overview
Brick-and-mortar retailers today face tightening margins amid decreased foot traffic and increased SKU complexity . Yet, studies show that the majority of purchase decisions (around 60%) are made in-store at the shelf . This makes it critical to optimize every inch of shelf and floor space. In fact, shelf space optimization is defined as the process of identifying the best location for every SKU in order to maximize sales . Advanced analytics and AI can help achieve this, guiding smarter category management and space planning decisions .
SmartShelf AI is an AI-driven retail space optimization project that tackles this challenge for grocery and convenience stores. It leverages historical sales data and product specifications to recommend optimal product placements at both the shelf level (planogram optimization) and the store layout level (zoning and foot-traffic optimization). The system uses predictive modeling to classify products into high, medium, and low performers, and mathematical optimization techniques (linear/integer programming via PuLP/OR-Tools) to allocate shelf space in a way that maximizes revenue per square foot  while respecting real-world constraints like shelf dimensions and category adjacencies. An interactive Streamlit dashboard is provided for users to simulate layouts and visualize “before vs. after” floor plans and shelf allocations, making it easy to see the impact of optimization. By combining data-driven insights with optimization, SmartShelf AI helps ensure the right product is in the right place at the right time, driving higher sales and efficiency.
Features
• Planogram Optimization: Automates shelf-level product placement. Using product dimensions (height, width, depth) and historical sales data, SmartShelf AI computes the optimal arrangement of products on shelves. It ensures that top-selling SKUs receive prime shelf space (e.g. eye-level positions, more facings) and that products fit within shelf space constraints (no exceeding shelf width or height limits). The optimization model maximizes total expected revenue from the shelf space, effectively maximizing revenue per square foot by allocating space to the most profitable items . Constraints like shelf height/width and even category adjacency (e.g. keeping complementary categories nearby) are incorporated to ensure feasible, shopper-friendly layouts. This approach is grounded in well-researched retail optimization models , formulated as an integer linear program solved with PuLP or Google OR-Tools.
• Store Layout Zoning & Foot-Traffic Simulation: Optimizes the macro-level store layout. The store is divided into zones (e.g. aisles or sections), and SmartShelf AI recommends where each product category or department should reside to improve customer flow and exposure of high-margin areas. Using foot-traffic simulation (e.g. a heatmap model of customer movement patterns), the system can virtually test different layouts. For example, it might suggest placing high-performing or impulse categories along high-traffic paths and near the entrance, while clustering related categories to encourage cross-selling. By simulating shopper movement, the tool helps minimize congestion and ensure optimal product adjacency, aligning with strategies used by leading retailers to improve the shopping experience . The result is a store layout that not only maximizes sales but also enhances customer convenience and navigation.
• Predictive SKU Performance Classification: Employs machine learning to categorize each SKU as High, Medium, or Low performing. SmartShelf AI trains a predictive model (e.g. using a classification algorithm or an ABC analysis heuristic) on historical sales data to identify the top performers that drive the majority of revenue. For instance, using an approach analogous to ABC analysis, it can categorize SKUs into A (top ~20% of items generating ~80% of revenue), B (moderate performers), and C (lower performers) . This classification informs the optimization: “A” items get priority placement (eye-level shelves, more stock), “B” items get secondary placement, and “C” items might be given minimal space or considered for removal. The model can incorporate various features (sales velocity, profit margin, category, seasonality) to predict performance of new or existing SKUs. By forecasting SKU success, the system helps planners decide which products deserve prominent spots and which can be downsized or eliminated, ensuring every product on the shelf earns its keep.
• Mathematical Optimization Engine: At the core of SmartShelf AI is a mathematical optimization engine that translates the business goal (maximizing revenue density) into a formal problem. It uses linear programming (with integer constraints) to decide how to allocate limited shelf space and store areas to products. The objective function maximizes total projected sales revenue (or profit) from all products placed, divided by the area they occupy (thus maximizing revenue per sq. ft.). Constraints model the real-world limitations: each shelf has a fixed width and height, so the sum of product widths on a shelf cannot exceed it, and a product’s height must fit on its designated shelf. Additional constraints can enforce category adjacency rules (e.g. ensure snacks are next to beverages, and away from cleaning supplies), inventory levels, or a minimum/maximum number of facings for certain items. The optimization is solved with open-source libraries like PuLP (which can interface with solvers like CBC) or Google OR-Tools, ensuring solutions are found efficiently. The solver may recommend, for example, giving 2 facings to a top cereal brand and 1 facing to a low seller, or placing a high-margin item on the endcap. This algorithmic approach guarantees that the final planogram and layout are optimal (or near-optimal) given the inputs, rather than based on guesswork or purely manual planogram design.
• Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit): A user-friendly Streamlit app acts as the front-end for SmartShelf AI. The dashboard allows users to input or adjust parameters (such as selecting a particular aisle to optimize, or toggling a scenario with a new product introduction) and then run the optimization to see results in real time. It visualizes the floor plan and shelf plan before and after optimization side by side. For the floor layout, the app might display a simple map of the store with color-coded sections for each category; for shelf plans, it could show a schematic of shelves with product labels. Users can clearly see how products and sections have moved. The app can also display summary metrics (e.g. total projected revenue increase, revenue per sq ft before vs after, average customer walking distance, etc.) to quantify the impact. This interactive “sandbox” lets store planners and category managers simulate different strategies (such as what if we allocate more space to beverages? or what if we move snacks near the register?) and immediately visualize outcomes. The dashboard thus makes the advanced optimization insights accessible and actionable for non-technical stakeholders.
